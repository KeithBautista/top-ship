## Project Goals
Top-Ship is an application that mimics the very popular boardgame "Battleship", though with a little Top-Gun twist :)

### User Goals
- Enjoy a memorable game such as Battleship and also get lost in the sea with hints of Top-Gun loitered about.

### Site Owner Goals
- Providing users with the ability to play a fun filled game from their childhood at the tips of their fingers and without having to clean up!
